This uses RichText. Check the roblox DevForumn for a list of tags and formats.;
All you need to know is that you start your emssage with a Forwards Slash to;
make it a comment. Each tag has a tag name "B" (bold) and a property " color="rgb(255,255,255)" ".;
Please note that this is <b>NOT HTML</b> although it does share the same tag and property system.;
Currently doesn't support scripting, only static pages.;
